# Telemetry Feedback Loop Improvements - Summary

## What Was Added

Enhanced the telemetry system to provide complete visibility into how tool execution results flow back into the agent's reasoning process.

## Changes Made

### 1. Code Changes (`src/linus/agents/agent/reasoning_agent.py`)

Added **6 new trace events** at strategic points in the agent execution loop:

| Event | Purpose | Location |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `tool_execution_completed` | Mark successful tool execution | After tool.run() completes |
| `context_updated_with_tool_result` | Show tool result added to context | After context update in main loop |
| `context_updated_with_llm_response` | Show LLM response added to context | After non-tool task completion |
| `reasoning_input_with_history` | Show accumulated context before reasoning | Before reasoning call (when history exists) |
| `task_completion_checked` | Show completion assessment | After completion check |
| `continuing_to_next_iteration` | Show iteration continuation decision | Before loop continues |

### 2. Documentation

Created three documents:

- **`docs/TELEMETRY_IMPROVEMENTS.md`**: Comprehensive guide to new trace events with examples
- **`test_trace_improvements.py`**: Test script to verify the new events in Langfuse
- **`TELEMETRY_FEEDBACK_LOOP_SUMMARY.md`**: This summary document

Updated:
- **`CLAUDE.md`**: Added reference to telemetry improvements

## The Problem Solved

**Before**: Traces showed tool execution and next reasoning call, but the connection was unclear:
```
tool_calculator (span) → Output: "714"
↓ [HOW DOES THIS FEED BACK?]
reasoning_phase (span) → Input: ???
```

**After**: Explicit trace of the feedback loop:
```
tool_calculator (span)
  └── Output: "714"
  └── EVENT: tool_execution_completed

EVENT: context_updated_with_tool_result
  - result_preview: "714"
  - context_length: 245

EVENT: reasoning_input_with_history
  - context_preview: "...Latest result: 714"
  - history_items_count: 1

reasoning_phase (span)
  └── Input: [context with tool result]
```

## How to Test

Run the test script:

```bash
python test_trace_improvements.py
```

This will:
1. Execute a simple calculation query
2. Generate traces with all new events
3. Flush to Langfuse with session ID: `test-trace-feedback-loop`
4. Print what to look for in the Langfuse UI

## What You'll See in Langfuse

When viewing the trace in Langfuse, you'll now see:

1. **Clear feedback loop**: Tool result → Context update → Next reasoning with accumulated context
2. **Context growth**: Track how context size grows across iterations
3. **Iteration logic**: See exactly why the agent continues or stops
4. **Result incorporation**: Preview of what information is being fed back

## Key Benefits

✅ **Visibility**: Complete view of the agent's decision loop
✅ **Debugging**: Identify where context breaks or loops occur
✅ **Monitoring**: Track context growth and iteration patterns
✅ **Understanding**: See how multi-step reasoning works
✅ **Performance**: Detect inefficient iteration patterns

## Implementation Details

- Works with both `AgentTracer` (OpenTelemetry) and `LangfuseTracer`
- Applied to both sync (`run`) and async (`arun`) execution paths
- Event data includes previews (truncated to 200 chars) to avoid overwhelming traces
- Context length tracking helps identify memory issues

## Files Modified

1. `src/linus/agents/agent/reasoning_agent.py` - Added 6 new trace events
2. `CLAUDE.md` - Updated telemetry section
3. `docs/TELEMETRY_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - New comprehensive guide
4. `test_trace_improvements.py` - New test script

## Next Steps

To use the improved telemetry:

1. **Enable Langfuse** in your `.env`:
   ```bash
   TELEMETRY_ENABLED=true
   TELEMETRY_EXPORTER=langfuse
   LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_key
   LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret
   ```

2. **Run your agent** - traces will automatically include new events

3. **View in Langfuse UI** - see the complete feedback loop

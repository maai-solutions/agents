# IMPORTANT REMINDER FOR CLAUDE

## Always Activate Conda Environment First!

Before running ANY Python or pip commands, ALWAYS activate the conda environment:

```bash
conda activate agents
```

## Correct Command Pattern

Instead of:
```bash
python script.py
pip install package
```

Always use:
```bash
source /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate agents && python script.py
source /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate agents && pip install package
```

## Verifying Environment

To check if you're in the correct environment:
```bash
source /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate agents && echo $CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV
```

Should output: `agents`

## Why This Matters

- The `agents` conda environment has all required packages installed
- Running in base or no environment will cause import errors
- Package installations in wrong environment won't be available to the app
